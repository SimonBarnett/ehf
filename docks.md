# Docks in the Economic and Humanitarian Fleet (EHF)

## Overview
Docks are multi-functional assets within the **EHF** system, primarily designed to handle ship construction and maintenance, while also serving educational and training purposes. They represent a vital intersection between economic development, education, and humanitarian efforts, especially in coastal towns.

## Key Functionalities

### **Ship Construction**
- **Drydock Management**: Docks feature one or more drydocks where ships can be built. Each drydock can manage one ship at a time, from beginning to completion of construction.
- **Ship Types**: Various types of ships can be constructed, including:
  - Cargo Ships
  - Passenger Ships
  - Hospital Ships
  - Naval Vessels

  The type of ship available for construction depends on the upgrades and the blueprint library of the dock.

- **Construction Process**:
  - Ships are built based on predefined blueprints which detail construction time, cost, and resources needed.
  - The construction progress is time-based, with completion dependent on the simulation's time advancement.

### **Educational and Training Facilities**
- **Naval and Engineering Training**: Docks offer specialized training in:
  - Basic Naval Training
  - Naval Engineering
  - Advanced Naval Engineering

  These training programs are crucial for preparing workforce for both economic and humanitarian missions.

- **Upgrades for Education**: 
  - **Naval School Upgrade**: Enhances the capability to offer more advanced or specialized naval training courses.
  - **Large Classroom Upgrades**: Allows for larger class sizes or more classes, increasing capacity for education.

### **Human Resource Management**
- **Placement of Personnel**:
  - During construction, civil engineers or those with advanced civil engineering training are placed to oversee the building process.
  - Once operational, docks require:
    - Naval engineers for maintenance and further construction.
    - Security personnel for force protection.
    - Educational staff for training programs.

- **Dynamic Staffing**: The number of placements can vary based on ongoing projects, upgrades, and the operational status of the docks.

### **Upgrades**
- **Drydock Expansion**: Additional drydocks can be added through upgrades, increasing the capacity for simultaneous ship construction.
- **Catering Upgrade**: Ensures that facilities are available to support the workforce and students, potentially offering catering placements.

## Operational Mechanics
- **Building and Placement**: 
  - Docks are built on brownfield sites near coastal towns, selected for strategic or economic benefits.
  - Upon completion or upgrade, callbacks are used to trigger additional functionalities like adding new classes or initiating ship construction.

- **Time-Based Events**: 
  - Construction, upgrades, and training programs are managed on a daily, monthly, or academic year basis, reflecting real-world time constraints and project management.

- **Integration with Broader EHF System**:
  - Docks interact with other assets like schools or hospitals for shared resources or personnel.
  - They contribute to the economy by creating jobs and training a skilled workforce, while also supporting humanitarian missions through ship construction.

## Conclusion
Docks in the EHF system are not just manufacturing hubs but are also educational centers and key economic drivers. Their functionality spans from direct shipbuilding to fostering skill development, showcasing the versatility and depth of the EHF simulation framework.
