**Notes:**

- **Costs**: Build costs continue to rise with ongoing construction. Maintenance and operational costs begin as one fleet starts operations. Staff costs increase with the addition of crew and additional trainers.
- **Employment**: Direct employment grows with the crew for the first operational fleet, increased construction workers, and more academic staff. Indirect employment also starts to grow due to the economic activity generated by the fleet.
- **Economic Benefits**: With the first fleet operational, benefits like aid delivery, local development, and soft power start to accumulate. Economic purchasing benefits from the multiplier effect, and there's a nascent impact from university-related activities. However, many benefits are still minimal or non-existent as the project scales up.
