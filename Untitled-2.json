Here's the updated JSON for year 1, adjusting for the need for educational staff before the first fleet operation and workers for fleet construction from year 1:

Notes:

Staff and Infrastructure Costs: Educational staff are in place from the year before the first fleet begins operation, hence their costs are included. Initial construction costs for docks, academic facilities, and headquarters are also accounted for.
Employment: Includes construction workers from the start, academic staff for training, and HQ staff for planning. Indirect employment is set to zero as no operational activities generate indirect jobs yet.
Economic Benefits: Remain at zero since no operational activities have started to generate these benefits. The total_estimated_value is kept at the expenditure for simplicity, although in reality, there might be some economic benefits from the construction activities.
