**Notes on Drone Swarm:**

- **Cost Price**: Reflects the cost for a complete swarm, including multiple drones, control systems, and support infrastructure.
- **Build Time**: Assumes time needed for assembly, programming, and initial testing of the swarm.
- **Maintenance**: Involves updating software, checking and replacing parts of individual drones, and ensuring the control systems are up to date.
- **Overhaul**: Might include significant upgrades to the drone fleet or control software, potentially replacing older units with newer models.
- **Expected Lifetime**: Shorter due to the rapid pace of technological change in drone technology and the physical wear on small drones, though individual drones might be replaced within the swarm to extend its operational life.
